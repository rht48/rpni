# rpni

This is a visualization of the PTA and RPNI algorithm.

HOW TO USE :
First, you need to put positive and negative expamples in the + and - files in the res folder.  
You need to put a semi-colon (;) in between each transition (ex: a;a;b;a).  
1 line in the file means 1 example.  
For the null example, you have to put nothing in one line.  

Finally, run the code and see what the algorithm does !  
To advance in the algorithm, push the right key. To go back, push the left key.

Project needs to be compiled beforehand !
